## 💡 Tips for Working on Projects

1. **Start small** - Get the basic version working first
2. **Add features gradually** - Don't try to build everything at once
3. **Test frequently** - Run your program often to catch errors early
4. **Experiment** - Try adding your own features and improvements
5. **Don't be afraid to break things** - That's how you learn!

## 🎨 Project Ideas for You to Try

Once you're comfortable with the provided projects, try creating your own:

1. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** - Play against the computer
2. **Simple Quiz Game** - Ask questions and keep score
3. **Password Generator** - Create random passwords
4. **Unit Converter** - Convert between different measurements
5. **Mad Libs Generator** - Create funny stories with user input

## 🏆 Challenge Yourself

For each project, try to add these extra features:
- Better user interface with colors or ASCII art
- Save high scores to a file
- Add sound effects (using `Console.Beep()`)
- Create difficulty levels
- Add easter eggs and hidden features

Remember: The best way to learn programming is by building things you find interesting and fun!
