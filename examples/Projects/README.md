## 💡 Tips for Working on Projects

1. **Start small** - Get the basic version working first
2. **Add features gradually** - Don't try to build everything at once
3. **Test frequently** - Run your program often to catch errors early
4. **Experiment** - Try adding your own features and improvements
5. **Don't be afraid to break things** - That's how you learn!
