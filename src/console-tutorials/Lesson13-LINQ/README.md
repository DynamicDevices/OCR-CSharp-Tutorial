# Lesson 13: LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

Welcome to LINQ - one of the most powerful and elegant features of C#! LINQ allows you to query and manipulate data collections using a SQL-like syntax directly in your C# code.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Understanding LINQ and its benefits
- Query syntax vs Method syntax
- Filtering, selecting, and ordering data
- Grouping and aggregation operations
- Joining collections
- Working with different data sources
- Performance considerations and best practices
- Deferred vs immediate execution

## 🔍 What is LINQ?

**LINQ (Language Integrated Query)** is a feature that allows you to write queries directly in C# using a SQL-like syntax. It works with any collection that implements `IEnumerable<T>`.

### Key Benefits:
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking of queries
- **IntelliSense Support**: Auto-completion and error detection
- **Unified Syntax**: Same syntax for different data sources
- **Powerful Operations**: Complex data manipulation made simple
- **Readable Code**: Queries are self-documenting

### LINQ Flavors:
- **LINQ to Objects**: Query in-memory collections
- **LINQ to SQL**: Query SQL databases
- **LINQ to XML**: Query XML documents
- **LINQ to Entities**: Query Entity Framework

## 📚 Two Syntax Styles

### Method Syntax (Fluent Syntax)
```csharp
var result = numbers
    .Where(n => n % 2 == 0)
    .Select(n => n * n)
    .OrderBy(n => n);
```

### Query Syntax (SQL-like)
```csharp
var result = from n in numbers
             where n % 2 == 0
             orderby n
             select n * n;
```

**Both produce the same result!** Use whichever feels more natural.

## 🔧 Core LINQ Operations

### 1. Filtering (Where)
```csharp
// Method syntax
var adults = people.Where(p => p.Age >= 18);

// Query syntax
var adults = from p in people
             where p.Age >= 18
             select p;
```

### 2. Projection (Select)
```csharp
// Transform data
var names = people.Select(p => p.Name);
var summary = people.Select(p => new { p.Name, p.Age });
```

### 3. Ordering (OrderBy, OrderByDescending)
```csharp
var sorted = people.OrderBy(p => p.Age).ThenBy(p => p.Name);
var descending = people.OrderByDescending(p => p.Grade);
```

### 4. Grouping (GroupBy)
```csharp
var ageGroups = people.GroupBy(p => p.Age);
foreach (var group in ageGroups)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Age {group.Key}: {group.Count()} people");
}
```

### 5. Aggregation
```csharp
int total = numbers.Sum();
double average = numbers.Average();
int maximum = numbers.Max();
int count = people.Count(p => p.Age > 21);
bool hasAdults = people.Any(p => p.Age >= 18);
bool allAdults = people.All(p => p.Age >= 18);
```

### 6. Set Operations
```csharp
var unique = list1.Union(list2);          // Combine, remove duplicates
var common = list1.Intersect(list2);     // Common elements
var different = list1.Except(list2);     // Elements only in list1
var distinct = list1.Distinct();         // Remove duplicates
```

## 🔗 Joining Collections

### Inner Join
```csharp
var studentCourses = from s in students
                     join c in courses on s.CourseId equals c.Id
                     select new { s.Name, c.Title };
```

### Group Join
```csharp
var studentsWithCourses = from s in students
                          join c in courses on s.Id equals c.StudentId into studentCourses
                          select new { Student = s, Courses = studentCourses };
```

### Left Join (using DefaultIfEmpty)
```csharp
var allStudents = from s in students
                  join c in courses on s.Id equals c.StudentId into temp
                  from c in temp.DefaultIfEmpty()
                  select new { s.Name, CourseName = c?.Title ?? "No Course" };
```

## ⚡ Performance Best Practices

### 1. Deferred Execution
```csharp
// Query is not executed yet
var query = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);

// Executed when enumerated
foreach (int n in query) { } // Executes now

// Force immediate execution
var list = query.ToList();   // Executes immediately
```

### 2. Efficient Filtering
```csharp
// Good: Filter early
var result = data
    .Where(item => item.IsActive)     // Filter first
    .Select(item => item.Name)        // Then transform
    .Take(10);                        // Limit results

// Avoid: Transform then filter
var inefficient = data
    .Select(item => new { item.Name, item.IsActive })  // Transform all
    .Where(x => x.IsActive)                            // Filter later
    .Take(10);
```

### 3. Existence Checks
```csharp
// Efficient - stops at first match
bool hasAdults = people.Any(p => p.Age >= 18);

// Inefficient - counts all matches
bool hasAdults2 = people.Where(p => p.Age >= 18).Count() > 0;
```

### 4. Memory Usage
```csharp
// Memory efficient for large collections
foreach (var item in data.Where(x => x.IsValid))
{
    Process(item);
}

// Memory intensive - loads all into memory
var validItems = data.Where(x => x.IsValid).ToList();
```

## 🔍 Advanced LINQ Techniques

### 1. Custom Comparers
```csharp
var sorted = names.OrderBy(name => name, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

### 2. Multiple Data Sources
```csharp
var combined = from n1 in numbers1
               from n2 in numbers2
               where n1 < n2
               select new { n1, n2 };
```

### 3. Conditional Logic
```csharp
var filtered = people.Where(p => 
    includeMinors ? true : p.Age >= 18);
```

### 4. Dynamic Queries
```csharp
IQueryable<Person> query = people.AsQueryable();

if (ageFilter.HasValue)
    query = query.Where(p => p.Age >= ageFilter);

if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(nameFilter))
    query = query.Where(p => p.Name.Contains(nameFilter));
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### 1. Multiple Enumeration
```csharp
// BAD: Query executed multiple times
var expensiveQuery = data.Where(ComplexFilter);
var count = expensiveQuery.Count();           // Executes query
var items = expensiveQuery.ToList();          // Executes query again

// GOOD: Execute once
var results = data.Where(ComplexFilter).ToList();
var count = results.Count;
var items = results;
```

### 2. Null Reference Issues
```csharp
// BAD: Potential null reference
var names = people.Select(p => p.Address.City);

// GOOD: Handle nulls
var names = people
    .Where(p => p.Address != null)
    .Select(p => p.Address.City);
```

### 3. Inefficient Nested Queries
```csharp
// BAD: N+1 query problem
var studentsWithCourses = students.Select(s => new
{
    Student = s,
    Courses = courses.Where(c => c.StudentId == s.Id).ToList()
});

// GOOD: Use proper joins
var studentsWithCourses = from s in students
                          join c in courses on s.Id equals c.StudentId into studentCourses
                          select new { Student = s, Courses = studentCourses };
```
