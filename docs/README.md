# C# Programming Tutorial for OCR A-Level Computer Science

Welcome to your C# programming journey! This tutorial is specifically designed for OCR A-Level Computer Science students, covering the programming fundamentals required for the specification with hands-on examples and exam-style exercises.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives (OCR A-Level Aligned)

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Write and run C# programs following good programming practices
- Understand and implement different data types, variables, and constants
- Use selection (if/else, switch) and iteration (for, while, do-while) constructs
- Create and use subroutines (methods) with parameters and return values
- Apply object-oriented programming principles (classes, objects, inheritance)
- Implement algorithms and data structures relevant to A-Level requirements
- Debug programs and handle exceptions appropriately

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- .NET SDK installed (we'll help you with this!)
- A text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installing .NET SDK

1. Visit [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2. Download and install the latest .NET SDK for your operating system
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and run: `dotnet --version`
4. You should see a version number (e.g., 8.0.100)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the C# extension:
1. Download VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the C# extension by Microsoft
3. Open this tutorial folder in VS Code

## 📚 Tutorial Structure (OCR A-Level Specification)

### Lesson 1: Program Structure and Basic Syntax
- Understanding program structure and syntax
- Input/output operations
- Comments and documentation
- **OCR Links**: Programming fundamentals, program flow

### Lesson 2: Data Types and Variables
- Primitive data types (int, double, bool, char, string)
- Variable declaration, initialization, and scope
- Constants and literals
- Type conversion and casting
- **OCR Links**: Data representation, variable types

### Lesson 3: Selection and Iteration
- Selection constructs (if/else, switch/case)
- Iteration constructs (for, while, do-while)
- Boolean logic and comparison operators
- **OCR Links**: Programming constructs, computational thinking

### Lesson 4: Subroutines and Modular Programming
- Function/method definition and calling
- Parameters (by value/by reference)
- Return values and local/global variables
- **OCR Links**: Subroutines, structured programming

### Lesson 5: Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes, objects, and instantiation
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Access modifiers and information hiding
- **OCR Links**: OOP principles, software design

## 🎮 Assessment-Style Projects

Each lesson includes exam-style programming tasks:
- Algorithm implementation exercises
- Problem-solving scenarios
- Code analysis and debugging tasks
- Design and documentation challenges

## 💡 Study Tips for OCR A-Level Success

1. **Practice pseudocode** - Learn to plan before coding
2. **Understand theory** - Connect programming to CS theory
3. **Trace through code** - Practice dry runs and debugging
4. **Document your work** - Use meaningful variable names and comments
5. **Think algorithmically** - Break problems into smaller steps
6. **Review mark schemes** - Understand what examiners look for
